Redundancy is the **duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing the reliability of the system, usually in the form of backup or fail-safe or to improve actual system performance.** For example, if there is only one copy of a file stored on a single server, then losing that server means losing the file. Since losing data is seldom a good thing, we can create duplicate or redundant copies of the file to solve this problem.

**Redundancy plays a key role in removing the single points of failure in the system and provides backups if needed in a crisis.** For example, if we have two instances of service running in production and one fails, the system can failover to the other one.

**Replication means sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant resources, such as software or hardware components, to improve reliability, fault-tolerance or accessibility.**

**Replication is widely used in many database management systems, usually with a primary-replica relationship between the original and the copies. The primary server all the updates, which then ripple through to the replica servers. Each replica outputs a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing the sending of subsequent updates.**
